**Objective:**  
The goal of the game is to guess a randomly chosen number within a specific range in as few attempts as possible.

**How to Play:**

1. **Setup:**
   - **Range:** Define a range of numbers within which the secret number will be chosen. For example, you might choose a range from 1 to 100.
   - **Secret Number:** A random number is generated within this range and kept hidden from the player.

2. **Gameplay:**
   - The player starts by making a guess, which is a number they believe might be the secret number.
   - After each guess, the game provides feedback:
     - **Too Low:** The guess is lower than the secret number.
     - **Too High:** The guess is higher than the secret number.
     - **Correct:** The guess matches the secret number, and the player wins!

3. **Winning and Losing:**
   - The player wins by guessing the secret number. The game might display the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.
   - Some variations of the game might include a maximum number of attempts. If the player fails to guess the number within these attempts, they lose the game.

4. **Optional Features:**
   - **Hints:** The game might offer additional hints or clues to help narrow down the possibilities.
   - **Difficulty Levels:** Different levels of difficulty can be added by changing the range or limiting the number of guesses.

**Example Gameplay:**

1. The game sets the range from 1 to 50 and chooses a secret number, say 27.
2. The player guesses 15. The game responds, "Too Low."
3. The player guesses 40. The game responds, "Too High."
4. The player guesses 27. The game responds, "Correct! You've guessed the number!"

**End of Game:**
- The game ends when the player guesses the secret number or exhausts the maximum allowed guesses. The player can start a new game with a different range or number of attempts.

**Purpose:**
The number guessing game is designed to be a fun, engaging way to test one's logical thinking and deduction skills. It's suitable for players of all ages and can be played casually or as a competitive challenge.
